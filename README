Install
-------

To install:
1) drop this repo into a ~/.vim.
2) create softlinks from ~/.vimrc to ~/.vim/vimrc and ~/.gvimrc to ~/.vim/gvimrc


License
-------

Not sure what licenses would be applicable to configuration files, so I'm
simply releasing my configurations as "Free". Ie: public domain.

Also worth noting that I've gotten inspiration from other documentation soruces
(vim wiki for example), which didn't explicitly state licensing. So I think
public domain is the most reasonable on technical grounds.

This applies only to the configurations, and not the actual plugins. 

Contact me if you really need a more specific answer.
